# Devskiller Excercise

A coding challenge that I had to do for a company

## Problem Statement

1. Make tests pass by implementing missing features in the production code.
2. Make the app work in a way described below. The majority of the code is committed, but there are some missing pieces that have to be implemented.

## TODOs

1. The `redux-form` reducer needs to be attached in the `store/rootReducer.js` file.
2. The `removeComponent` action creator is missing. It should be implemented.
3. Handle the `ADD_COMPONENT` action in `store/components/reducer.js`.
4. Handle the  `UPDATE_COMPONENT` action in `store/components/reducer.js`.
5. Handle the `REMOVE_COMPONENT` action in `store/components/reducer.js`.
6. Handle the `SET_EDITED_COMPONENT` action in `store/components/reducer.js`.
7. The `a` HTML tag (link) has missing implementation in the `components/Components/A.js` file that needs to be fixed. After clicking on the link, a new tab should open.
8. The `img` HTML tag (image) has missing implementation in the `components/Components/Img.js` file that needs to be fixed.
9. The items of the components picker should be greyed out with the `components-picker__component--disabled` class and they should not be clickable when a component is being edited.
